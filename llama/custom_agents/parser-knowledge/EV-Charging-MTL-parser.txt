# MT Problem in EV Charging

We consider a single charging station in the Smart Home system context.

## Minimizing the duration of charge

Optimize the EV charging power to minimize the time duration of charging such that the battery is filled at the desired state of charge.
Performance metric: charging duration.

- $A = 1$
- $B = \frac{\Delta T}{Q}$
- $x_i = \text{SOC}_i$
- $x_f = \text{SOC}_f$
- $L_u = 0$
- $U_u = P_\text{max}$
- $L_x = 0$
- $U_x = 1$

where

- $\Delta T$ is the time step;
- $Q$ is the battery capacity;
- $\text{SOC}_i$ is the initial state of charge of the battery;
- $\text{SOC}_f$ is the desired state of charge of the battery;
- $P_\text{max}$ is the maximum charging power.

### Code example

- A = "1"
- B = "(req.deltaT / dt.timedelta(hours=1)) / self.battery_capacity"
- x_i = "self.current_SOC"
- x_f = "1"
- L_u = "0"
- U_u = "self.max_charging_power"
- L_x = "0"
- U_x = "1"
