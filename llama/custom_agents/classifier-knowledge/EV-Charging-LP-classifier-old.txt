# LP Problems in EV Charging

We consider a single charging station in the Smart Home system context.

## Minimizing Charging Cost Over a Time Period

Optimize the EV charging power to minimize the total electricity cost over a specified period.
Performance metric/key word: electricity expenses, charging cost, electricity bill, save money.

* $c$ : $w$
* $A = \begin{pmatrix}-\Delta T\cdots -\Delta T\end{pmatrix}$
* $b = -E_\text{req}$
* $A_\text{eq}, b_\text{eq}$ : None
* $l_b = 0$
* $u_b = \begin{pmatrix}P_\text{max}\cdots P_\text{max}\end{pmatrix}^\top$

where

* $w$ is the vector of electricity prices during charging time;
* $\Delta T$ is the time step;
* $E_\text{req}$ is the total energy required to charge the vehicle;
* $P_\text{max}$ is the maximum charging power.

### Request example

"Charge my EV but try to reduce the costs please."
"Guess it's time to charge the car but find me those bargain electricity hours, yeah?"
"Charge my vehicle but do it in a way thatâ€™s gentle on my expenses."
"Please, initiate EV charging but make it cost-effective."

## Minimizing Charging Cost with Renewable Energy Integration

Optimize the EV charging power to minimize the total electricity cost over a specified period by maximizing the use of renewable energy.
Performance metric/key wors: environmental impact, carbon-based energy emission, green energy, eco-conscious.

* $c$ : $w - r$
* $A = \begin{pmatrix}-\Delta T\cdots -\Delta T\end{pmatrix}$
* $b = -E_\text{req}$
* $A_\text{eq}, b_\text{eq}$ : None
* $l_b = 0$
* $u_b = \begin{pmatrix}P_\text{max}\cdots P_\text{max}\end{pmatrix}^\top$

where

* $w$ is the vector of prices during charging time;
* $r$ is the vector of renewable energy availability factor during charging time;
* $\Delta T$ is the time step;
* $E_\text{req}$ is the total energy required to charge the vehicle;
* $P_\text{max}$ is the maximum charging power.

### Request example

"Hey, can you make sure my EV charges but, like, in the most eco-friendly way?"
"Can you handle my EV charging in a way that's sympathetic to ecological concerns?"
"Find the time slots that minimize harm to the environment for my car's charging, please."
"Please, take advantage of renewable energy peaks to charge my car."
