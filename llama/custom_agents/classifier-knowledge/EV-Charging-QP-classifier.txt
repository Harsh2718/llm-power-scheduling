# QP Problem in EV Charging

We consider a single charging station in the Smart Home system context.

## Minimizing the power variations

Optimize the EV charging power to minimize the power variations on the charger.
Performance metric/key words: smooth EV charger power, EV charger lifetime, protect charger.

* $Q = 2I_N$
* $c$ : None
* $A = \begin{pmatrix}-\Delta T\cdots -\Delta T\end{pmatrix}$
* $b = -E_\text{req}$
* $A_\text{eq}, b_\text{eq}$ : None
* $l_b = 0$
* $u_b = \begin{pmatrix}P_\text{max}\cdots P_\text{max}\end{pmatrix}^\top$

where

* $\Delta T$ is the time step;
* $E_\text{req}$ is the total energy required to charge the vehicle;
* $P_\text{max}$ is the maximum charging power.

### Request example

"I need the EV charge but focus on smooth power at the charger."
"Could you, uh, please ensure that the variations are minimized while charging the EV? Uh, the charger needs to be preserved."
"Charge the Tesla without overloading the charger, okay?"
"Keep the power consistent for my Kia."
