# MTL Problem in EV Charging

We consider a single charging station in the Smart Home system context.

## Minimizing the duration of charge

Optimize the EV charging power to minimize the time duration of charging such that the battery is filled at the desired state of charge.
Performance metric/key word: charging duration, EV availability, speed, time.

* $A = 1$
* $B = \\frac{\\Delta T}{Q}$
* $x_i = \\text{SOC}\_i$
* $x_f = \\text{SOC}\_f$
* $L_u = 0$
* $U_u = \\begin{pmatrix}P\_\\text{max}\\cdots P\_\\text{max}\\end{pmatrix}^\\top$
* $L_x = 0$
* $U_x = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\cdots 1\\end{pmatrix}^\\top$

where

* $\\Delta T$ is the time step;
* $Q$ is the battery capacity;
* $\\text{SOC}\_i$ is the initial state of charge of the battery;
* $\\text{SOC}\_f$ is the desired state of charge of the battery;
* $P\_\\text{max}$ is the maximum charging power.

### Request example

"I need my EV charge as soon as possible please."
"Could we look into quicker charging methods for my vehicle?"
"Can we ensure the car is ready faster by adjusting the charge settings?"
"Ensure the charging time is minimized; I need it quick."
