# MM Problems in EV Charging

We consider a single charging station in the Smart Home system context.

## Minimize power Peak to Average Ratio (PAR)

Minimize the PAR to avoid power peaks on the grid. It corresponds to minimize the maximum power load on the grid.
Performance metric/key word: grid power peaks, electrical installation lifetime, power peak, protect home from overload, minimize power consumption peaks on grid.

- $f_i(x) = x_i + L_i$
- $A = \begin{pmatrix}-\Delta T\cdots -\Delta T\end{pmatrix}$
- $b = -E_{req}$
- $A_\text{eq},b_\text{eq}$ : None
- $l_b = 0$
- $u_b = \begin{pmatrix}P_\text{max}\cdots P_\text{max}\end{pmatrix}^\top$

where

* $L$ is the non-flexible load vector;
* $\Delta T$ is the time step;
* $E_\text{req}$ is the total energy required to charge the vehicle;
* $P_\text{max}$ is the maximum charging power.

### Request example

"Charge my EV while minimizing the power peak on the grid please."
"Let's get my EV charged without making a peak in our home's power usage."
"I'd like a charging plan that doesn't stress our electricity grid too much."
"Let's aim to, you know, minimize the power peaks while charging the car tonight."
